// this will eventually be loaded from local storage
// new locations - dynamically shown based on view
// search only for existing map markers
initially hardcoded, later on dynamic
later on search will also get new markers
ability to save markers?

on click of a marker do the info popup per spec

to determine: does the underlying structure need bindings? it doesn't change
so we don't need it? or do we need to do it when we do dynamic markers? TBD

next steps:

-click activates & centers on marker w/animation
-click on map icon activates it (but does not center)
-external sources -ajax calls

then
-polish UI
-meet any other requirements needed

nice to have:
-spinner when loading
-minification via gulp & that other stuff
-2x external sources
-auto locations (generic search?)


todo (2015/09/11)
-redirects - show where it redirected from
-may refer to: (that landing page: need to see how to work around?)
-popup - hidden behind other info box
-close all option?
