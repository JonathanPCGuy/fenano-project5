// this will eventually be loaded from local storage
// new locations - dynamically shown based on view
// search only for existing map markers
initially hardcoded, later on dynamic
later on search will also get new markers
ability to save markers?

on click of a marker do the info popup per spec

to determine: does the underlying structure need bindings? it doesn't change
so we don't need it? or do we need to do it when we do dynamic markers? TBD
